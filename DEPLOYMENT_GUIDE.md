## üåê Deployment to Vercel

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
If your repository is connected to Vercel:

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Implement complete role-based notification system

   - Fixed reset button error handling
   - Added quiz creation notifications
   - Added attendance check-in notifications
   - Added quiz submission notifications
   - Added grading notifications
   - Implemented role-based notification storage
   - Updated notification pages for both roles"
   
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will automatically:**
   - Detect the push
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Deploy to production
   - Update `https://spmproject-web.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
If automatic deployment is not set up:

1. **Install Vercel CLI (if not installed):**
   ```powershell
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel:**
   ```powershell
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```powershell
   vercel --prod
   ```

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
‚úÖ Good signs:
- "üì± [NotificationContext] Loaded X notifications"
- "üì± [NotificationService] Stored notification"
- No error messages

‚ùå Bad signs:
- "Route not found" errors
- "Failed to load" errors
- TypeScript errors
```

### 2. Check localStorage
In DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage:
```
‚úÖ Should see:
- notifications_student (for student role)
- notifications_lecturer (for lecturer role)
- Each with different notification data

‚ùå Should NOT see:
- Single "notifications" key with mixed data
- Empty notification arrays after actions
```

### 3. Check Network Tab
Monitor API calls:
```
‚úÖ Expected calls:
- POST /api/attendance/check-in
- POST /api/grades/bulk-update
- GET /api/grades/enrolled

‚ö†Ô∏è Expected failures (gracefully handled):
- DELETE /api/attendance/reset/:id (shows warning, not error)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Clear localStorage
3. Logout and login again
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Same notifications for both roles
**Solution:**
1. Verify you're logged in with correct role
2. Check localStorage keys (should be role-specific)
3. Clear localStorage and try again

### Issue: Reset button still showing error
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for actual error
2. Verify the error handling code is deployed
3. Check network tab for API response

### Issue: Bell icon not showing count
**Solution:**
This is an optional feature not yet implemented.
See `COMPLETE_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` for integration instructions.

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Notification Delivery Rate**
   - Are notifications appearing after actions?
   - Are both roles receiving notifications?

2. **Error Rate**
   - Check for console errors
   - Monitor failed API calls
   - Track user-reported issues

3. **User Engagement**
   - Are users clicking on notifications?
   - Are notifications being read?
   - Are users finding them helpful?

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

### Quick Rollback
```powershell
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or rollback in Vercel dashboard
# Deployments ‚Üí Select previous deployment ‚Üí Promote to Production
```

### Partial Rollback
If only specific features are problematic:

1. **Disable notification service:**
   - Comment out notification function calls
   - Keep role-based storage
   - Redeploy

2. **Revert specific files:**
   ```powershell
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/components/Dashboard/RecordAttendance.tsx
   git commit -m "Revert attendance notifications"
   git push
   ```
