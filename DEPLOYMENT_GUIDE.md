# Or deploy from Vercel dashboard
# 1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Click "Deploy" or wait for auto-deploy
```

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Verify Build Success
Check Vercel dashboard for:
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Deployment live

### 2. Test on Production

#### As Lecturer:
```
1. Open: https://spmproject-web.vercel.app/lecturer/login
2. Login with lecturer credentials
3. Navigate to: Attendance page
4. Click "Allow" for browser notifications
5. Generate QR code session (if needed)
6. Keep page open
```

#### As Student (different browser/incognito):
```
1. Open: https://spmproject-web.vercel.app/student-login
2. Login with student credentials
3. Navigate to: Record Attendance
4. Scan QR code or enter session code
5. Wait for success message
```

#### Expected Results (within 2-4 seconds):
- ✅ Browser notification: "🎓 New Student Check-in"
- ✅ Green alert box appears (top-right)
- ✅ Attendance table updates
- ✅ Total count increases
- ✅ Console shows: `🔔 NEW ATTENDANCE DETECTED!`

### 3. Check Console Logs (F12)

**Successful flow should show:**
```
📱 Requesting notification permission on mount...
📱 Notification permission: granted
🔍 Debug - Token retrieved: Token exists
✅ Successfully loaded attendance data: X records
🔍 Real-time check - Records: X, Last count: X
🔔 NEW ATTENDANCE DETECTED! 1 new students
📢 Showing notification for: [Student Name]
🔔 SHOWING NOTIFICATION FOR: [Student Name] at [timestamp]
📱 Showing browser notification...
📢 Creating in-app notification...
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] **Build Status:** No errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] **Page Loads:** Lecturer attendance page loads correctly
- [ ] **Notification Permission:** Browser prompts for permission
- [ ] **Real-time Polling:** Console shows checks every 2 seconds
- [ ] **Student Scan:** QR code scanning works
- [ ] **Notification Appears:** Both browser and in-app notifications show
- [ ] **Table Updates:** Attendance table refreshes automatically
- [ ] **Count Accurate:** Total attendees number is correct
- [ ] **No False Alerts:** No notifications on initial page load
- [ ] **Multiple Scans:** Each student triggers separate notification

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Issue: Build Fails

**Check:**
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# If successful locally, check Vercel logs
# Look for: TypeScript errors, missing dependencies, etc.
```

### Issue: Changes Not Visible

**Solutions:**
1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear cache:** Browser settings → Clear browsing data
3. **Check deployment:** Verify correct branch deployed
4. **Incognito mode:** Test in private browsing

### Issue: Notifications Not Working

**Check:**
1. **Browser permission:** Look for 🔔 icon in address bar
2. **Console logs:** Press F12, look for error messages
3. **Network tab:** Verify API calls succeeding
4. **Backend status:** Ensure backend is running

## 📊 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Notification Delivery Time**
   - Target: 0-2 seconds after scan
   - Monitor: Console logs with timestamps

2. **API Response Time**
   - Endpoint: `/api/attendance/lecturer/:id`
   - Target: < 500ms

3. **Polling Performance**
   - Frequency: Every 2 seconds
   - Check: Network tab for consistent calls

4. **Error Rate**
   - Monitor: Console for `❌` errors
   - Target: 0% error rate

## 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues occur after deployment:

```bash
# 1. Revert to previous commit
git log  # Find previous commit hash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# 2. Or reset to previous commit
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push origin main --force

# 3. Vercel will auto-deploy the rollback
```
