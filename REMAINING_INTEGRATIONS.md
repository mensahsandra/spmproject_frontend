- After successful QR scan/check-in, add:
```typescript
import { notifyAttendanceCheckIn } from '../utils/notificationService';

// After successful check-in
notifyAttendanceCheckIn(studentName, courseCode, location);
```

**Search for:**
- Files containing "QR" or "scan" or "check-in"

- After successful quiz submission, add:
```typescript
import { notifyQuizSubmission } from '../utils/notificationService';

```

**Where to Integrate:**

- After successful grade submission, add:
```typescript
import { notifyQuizGraded, notifyBulkGrading } from '../../utils/notificationService';

// For single student grade
notifyQuizGraded(studentName, quizTitle, score, maxScore);

// For bulk grading
notifyBulkGrading(lecturerName, quizTitle, studentCount, studentNames);
```

**Integration Point:**
- Look for the grade submission success handler
- Add notification calls after successful API response

## üîî Bell Icon Count Integration

**Current Status:** Context already tracks `unreadCount`

**What to Do:**
1. Find bell icon components (likely in header/navbar)
2. Import notification context:
```typescript
import { useNotification } from '../context/NotificationContext';

function BellIcon() {
  const { unreadCount } = useNotification();
  
  return (
    <div className="relative">
      <BellIcon />
      {unreadCount > 0 && (
        <span className="badge">{unreadCount}</span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Search for:**
- Files with "bell" or "notification icon"
- Header/navbar components
- Top navigation components
