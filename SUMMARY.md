# Frontend Updates for Assessment Integration

## Current Implementation Snapshot
- **StudentQuizDashboard.tsx**: Calls `GET /api/assessments/student` without a request body and continues to honor backend guidance (course detection, empty-state handling, submission metadata, and archival/publish visibility).
- **assessmentManagement.ts**: Provides lecturer controls for archive/publish actions, sending `PATCH` updates per backend specification.
- **assessmentIntegrationExamples.ts**: Documents integration patterns and usage examples for the updated assessment workflows.

## Items Already Aligned with Backend Guidance
- Course context is detected automatically from the stored user object (supporting both `courses[]` and legacy `course`).
- Empty assessment arrays are treated as a valid "no active assessments" response.
- Assessments flagged `isArchived` are hidden from students; missing `isPublished` is treated as published.
- Submission metadata (status, submittedAt, score, grade, feedback) is surfaced in the UI when available.

## Recent Change Recap
- Switched the student assessment fetch back to `GET` and removed the unnecessary JSON payload so the frontend matches the backend contract exactly.
