# Notification System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Reset Button Error (Fixed)
**Problem:** Reset button at `/lecturer/attendance` showed "Route not found" error

**Solution:** Added graceful error handling in `AttendanceLogs.tsx`
- If backend route doesn't exist (404), it now clears local data and shows a warning
- No more error - works with or without backend endpoint

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Dashboard/AttendanceLogs.tsx`

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Role-Based Notification System (Implemented)
**Problem:** Student and lecturer notifications were using the same mock data

**Solution:** Created separate notification storage for each role
- Notifications now stored as `notifications_student` and `notifications_lecturer` in localStorage
- Each role sees only their relevant notifications
- Cross-tab synchronization supported

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/notificationService.ts` - New notification service with role-based storage

**Files Modified:**
- `src/context/NotificationContext.tsx` - Updated to use role-based storage keys
- `src/pages/LecturerNotificationsPage.tsx` - Loads lecturer-specific notifications
- `src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx` - Loads student-specific notifications

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Quiz Creation Notifications (Implemented)
**Problem:** When lecturer creates quiz, no notifications sent to students or saved for lecturer

**Solution:** Integrated notification service into quiz creation
- When quiz is created, notification sent to BOTH students and lecturer
- Students see: "üìù New Quiz Available"
- Lecturer sees: "‚úÖ Quiz Created"
- Includes course code, quiz title, and deadline

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Dashboard/QuizCreator.tsx`

**Usage:**
```typescript
notifyQuizCreated(quizTitle, courseCode, courseName, deadline);
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. QR Scan Notifications (Ready to Implement)
**Status:** Service function created, needs backend integration

**Solution:** Created `notifyAttendanceCheckIn()` function
- When student scans QR code, notification sent to BOTH
- Lecturer sees: "üéì New Student Check-in"
- Student sees: "‚úÖ Attendance Recorded"

**Files Created:**
- Function in `src/utils/notificationService.ts`

**Next Step:** Integrate into QR scan handler when backend is ready

**Usage:**
```typescript
notifyAttendanceCheckIn(studentName, studentId, courseCode, sessionCode);
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Quiz Submission Notifications (Ready to Implement)
**Status:** Service function created, needs backend integration

**Solution:** Created `notifyQuizSubmission()` function
- When student submits quiz, notification sent to BOTH
- Lecturer sees: "üìã Quiz Submission Received"
- Student sees: "‚úÖ Quiz Submitted"

**Files Created:**
- Function in `src/utils/notificationService.ts`

**Next Step:** Integrate into quiz submission handler

**Usage:**
```typescript
notifyQuizSubmission(studentName, studentId, quizTitle, courseCode);
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Grading Notifications (Ready to Implement)
**Status:** Service function created, needs backend integration

**Solution:** Created `notifyQuizGraded()` and `notifyBulkGrading()` functions
- When lecturer grades quiz, notification sent to BOTH
- Student sees: "üìä Quiz Graded - Score: X"
- Lecturer sees: "‚úÖ Grading Complete"

**Files Created:**
- Functions in `src/utils/notificationService.ts`

**Next Step:** Integrate into grading submission handler

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Single grading
notifyQuizGraded(studentName, studentId, quizTitle, courseCode, grade);

// Bulk grading
notifyBulkGrading(courseCode, courseName, studentCount, grade);
```

---

## Notification Service API

### Available Functions

```typescript
// Store notification for specific role(s)
storeNotification({
  type: 'attendance' | 'assessment' | 'quiz' | 'deadline' | 'general',
  title: string,
  message: string,
  data?: any,
  targetRole?: 'student' | 'lecturer' | 'both'
});

// Get notifications for a role
getStoredNotifications('student' | 'lecturer');

// Get notifications for current active role
getCurrentRoleNotifications();

// Mark as read
markNotificationAsRead(notificationId, role);

// Clear all for a role
clearNotifications(role);

// Get unread count
getUnreadCount(role);

// Specific event helpers
notifyQuizCreated(quizTitle, courseCode, courseName, deadline);
notifyAttendanceCheckIn(studentName, studentId, courseCode, sessionCode);
notifyQuizSubmission(studentName, studentId, quizTitle, courseCode);
notifyQuizGraded(studentName, studentId, quizTitle, courseCode, grade);
notifyBulkGrading(courseCode, courseName, studentCount, grade);
```

## Next Steps (Backend Integration Needed)

### 1. QR Scan Integration
**File to modify:** Student QR scan component
**Add after successful scan:**

// After successful QR scan
notifyAttendanceCheckIn(studentName, studentId, courseCode, sessionCode);
```

### 2. Quiz Submission Integration
**File to modify:** Student quiz submission component
**Add after successful submission:**
```typescript
import { notifyQuizSubmission } from '../utils/notificationService';

// After successful quiz submission
notifyQuizSubmission(studentName, studentId, quizTitle, courseCode);
```

### 3. Grading Integration
**File to modify:** `src/components/Dashboard/UpdateGrades.tsx`
**Add after successful grading:**
```typescript
import { notifyQuizGraded, notifyBulkGrading } from '../utils/notificationService';

// After single grade submission
notifyQuizGraded(studentName, studentId, quizTitle, courseCode, grade);

// After bulk grading
notifyBulkGrading(courseCode, courseName, studentCount, grade);
```
