## 🎨 UI Features

### Bell Icon Count (Ready for Integration)
The notification context already tracks `unreadCount`. To display it:

```typescript
import { useNotification } from '../context/NotificationContext';

function Header() {
  const { unreadCount } = useNotification();
  
  return (
    <div className="notification-bell">
      <BellIcon />
      {unreadCount > 0 && (
        <span className="badge">{unreadCount}</span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Search for bell icon component:**
```powershell
rg -i "bell|notification.*icon" --type tsx
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Notification Service Architecture
```typescript
// Storage keys
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  student: 'notifications_student',
  lecturer: 'notifications_lecturer'
};

// Notification interface
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  type: 'info' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error';
  message: string;
  timestamp: number;
  read: boolean;
  category?: string;
}

// Helper functions
- storeNotification(role, notification)
- getNotifications(role)
- markAsRead(role, notificationId)
- clearNotifications(role)
```

### Integration Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Import the service
import { notifyEventName } from '../utils/notificationService';

// 2. Call after successful action
try {
  await performAction();
  notifyEventName(param1, param2, param3);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle error
}
```
